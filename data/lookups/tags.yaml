    tag_type: gov_clusters
    description: |
        This vote is most similar to a group of votes where the opposition has proposed a motion and the government is strongly opposing it (few defections, high turnout).

    tag_type: gov_clusters
    description: |
        This vote is most similar to a group of votes where the motion is proposed by the opposition, the result is quite polarized, but there is a medium level of participation (most MPs, but not all).
        This usually reflects votes it would be embarrassing for the government to lose, but is not a major flashpoint.

    description: |
        This vote is most similar to a group of votes where the government is proposing a motion, but opposition is less strongly opposing it (higher numbers of absences).

        This vote is most similar to a group of votes where the government is voting against a motion, and opposition MPs/parties are divided in their support.

        This vote is most similar to a group of votes where the government is proposing a motion and the opposition is strongly opposing it (few defections, high turnout).
        This usually suggests an important point of principle, that even if the government is likely to win, is a significant public signal of opposition.

    tag_type: gov_clusters
    description: |
        This vote is most similar to a group of votes where there is a cross party consensus in favour of a motion.
        There may be scattered opposition (which is why a vote is being held at all), but it does not break down clearly along government/opposition lines.
