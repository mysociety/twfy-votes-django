  laws</b>
policy_description: |
  A vote for Labour's Anti-Terrorism Laws would have been a vote for the 
  crime known as 'terrorism' to be treated in a different manner from murder 
  and conspiracy to murder, and for it to have its own special category 
  meaning that the normal rights not to be detained without charge or trial 
  do not apply.
