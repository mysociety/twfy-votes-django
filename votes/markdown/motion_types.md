# Motion types

We group motions into common categories - this page describes the role they play in shaping internal and external parliamentary action. 

## First stage

This is the first stage/reading of a draft law.

It will introduce the topic area, but not the full details of the bill. 

## Second stage

This is the second stage/reading of a draft law. 

It introduces a complete bill that may be subject to future amendment. 

If this passes, in the House of Commons it will proceed to a committee stage. 

## Third stage

This is the third stage/reading of a draft law.

The chamber confirms the final text of the bill, and it will proceed to the Lords if it is a Commons bill (or to the Commons if it starts as a Lords bill).

## Ten minute rule

A Ten Minute Rule motion is a way for MPs to propose a law by making a brief speech of up to ten minutes in support of it. 

In practice, even when these pass they are unlikely to be given time in the schedule to become legislation. 

## Programme

A programme motion sets out the timetable and time available for a bill to be debated.

## Closure

Motion to stop debate and move to a vote on the main issue.

## Amendment

An amendment is a change to the text of a motion or bill.

## Reasoned amendment

A reasoned amendment is an attempt to convert 'this bill has passed the second stage' motions into 'this bill should not pass *because* reason a,b,c'.

This opposition amendment will rarely if ever passed - but is the framing for the opposition's final critique of the bill at this stage.

## Lords amendment

This is a vote to accept or reject a change made by the House of Lords to a bill.

## Committee clause

This is a vote to approve a clause in a bill.

## Second stage committee

This is a vote to approve clauses in a bill in committee.

## Timetable change

This is a vote to change the order of business in the chamber.

## Adjournment

This is a vote to end the day's business.

Adjournment debates are usually used as a mechanism to have a debate on a topic without a vote.

## Humble address

This is used as a way of Parliament compelling the government to release information.

## Government agenda

This is a vote on the government's agenda (monarch's speech).

## Financial

This is a vote on a financial instrument.

## Confidence

This is a vote of confidence in the government.

## Standing order change

This is a vote to change the rules of the chamber.

## Private sitting

This is a vote to sit in private.

Generally this is not a real vote about sitting in private, but because it is a vote that can be called by any MP, it can be used to end a low participation debate. 
Calling for the vote leads to a check if there are more than 40 MPs present, and if not, proceedings end. 

However, it can also only be called once a day, so sometimes people in *favour* of a debate will call for this vote earlier when there are more people around. This prevents it being used to close debate later on. 

## EU document scrutiny

Now historical, but a vote recognising an EU document in Parliament was a requirement before a minister could support in council.

## Other

This is a vote that doesn't fit into any current category.
