                    This vote is most similar to a group of votes where the opposition has proposed a motion and the government is strongly opposing it (few defections, high turnout).
                    This usually suggests an important point of principle, or that it would have substantive effects if passed.

                    This vote is most similar to a group of votes where the government is proposing a motion and the opposition is strongly opposing it (few defections, high turnout).
                    This usually suggests an important point of principle, that even if the government is likely to win, it is significant public signal of opposition.

                    This vote is most similar to a group of votes where the government is proposing a motion,
                    but there is division amoung opposition MPS in opposing it (but generally, leaning against).

                    This vote is most similar to a group of votes where the opposition is proposing a motion,
                    but there isn't complete high turnout in the government voting against.
                    The government will still typically win these, but the lower turnout on both sides is reflected in the lower stakes of the vote.

            {% endcase %}
            {% case "gov_aye_opp_weak_no" %}
                {% markdown %}
                    This vote is most similar to a group of votes where the government is proposing a motion,
                    but opposition is less strongly opposing it (low turnout).
                    This is usually a sign that the government will win the vote regardless, in principle opposition parties are against it,
                    but that it's not a significant enough issue to send a signal of strong opposition (versus other use of {{ decision.chamber.members_plural }} time).

                {% markdown %}
                    This vote is most similar to a group of votes where the government is voting against a motion, and *generally* opposition MPs are also voting against it.
                    This might reflect a vote bought by a smaller opposition party, or a group of government party rebels.

                {% markdown %}
                    This vote is most similar to a group of votes where there is low participation from both sides.
                    This might be non-contentious or procedural motions in the early stages of member proposed bills.

                {% markdown %}
                    This vote is most similar to a group of votes where there is a cross party consensus in favour of a motion.
                    There may be scattered opposition (which is why a vote is being held at all), but it does not break down clearly along government/oppoistion lines.
