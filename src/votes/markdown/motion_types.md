# Motion types

We group motions into common categories - this page describes the role they play in shaping internal and external parliamentary action. 

# First stage

This is the first stage or reading of a draft law.

It will introduce the topic area, but not the full details of the bill. 


# Second stage

This is the second reading or stage of a draft law. 

It introuduces a complete bill that may be subject to future amendment. 

If this passes, in the House of Commons it will proceed to a committee stage. 

# Reasoned amendment

A reasoned amendment is an attempt to convert 'this bill has passed the second stage' motions into 'this bill should not pass *because* reason a,b,c'.

This opposition amendment will rarely if ever passed - but is the framing for the opposition's final critique of the bill at this stage.
