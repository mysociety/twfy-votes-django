# Motion types

We group motions into common categories - this page describes the role they play in shaping internal and external parliamentary action. 

## First stage

This is the first stage or reading of a draft law.

It will introduce the topic area, but not the full details of the bill. 

## Second stage

This is the second reading or stage of a draft law. 

It introuduces a complete bill that may be subject to future amendment. 

If this passes, in the House of Commons it will proceed to a committee stage. 

## Third stage

This is the third reading or stage of a draft law.

The chamber confirms the final text of the bill, and it will proceed to the Lords if it is a Commons bill.


## Amendment

An amendment is a change to the text of a motion or bill.

## Reasoned amendment

A reasoned amendment is an attempt to convert 'this bill has passed the second stage' motions into 'this bill should not pass *because* reason a,b,c'.

This opposition amendment will rarely if ever passed - but is the framing for the opposition's final critique of the bill at this stage.

## Lords amendment

This is a vote to accept or reject a change made by the House of Lords to a bill.

## Committee clause

This is a vote to approve a clause in a bill.

## Second stage committee

This is a vote to approve clauses in a bill in committee.

## Timetable change

This is a vote to change the order of business in the chamber.

## Adjournment

This is a vote to end the day's business.

Adjournment debates are usually used as a mechanism to have a debate on a topic without a vote.

## Humble address

This is used as a way of Parliament compelling the government to release information.

## Government agenda

This is a vote on the government's agenda (monarch's speech).

## Financial

This is a vote on a financial instrument.

## Confidence

This is a vote of confidence in the government.

## Standing order change

This is a vote to change the rules of the chamber.

## Private sitting

This is a vote to sit in private.

Generally this isn't a real vote about sitting in private, but because its a vote that can be called by any MP, it's a way of ending debate but leading to a count of MPs for division. If there are less than 40 MPs present, the debate ends.

However, it can also only be called once a day, so sometimes people in *favour* of a debate will call for this vote earlier when there are more people around. 

## EU document scrutiny

Now historical, but a vote noting a document was a requirement before a minister could support in council.

## Other

This is a vote that doesn't fit into any current category.
