# About TheyWorkForYou Votes

TheyWorkForYou Votes is a parliamentary voting analysis website. 

The goal is to create better automated analysis of decisions taken in the UKs Parliaments. 

This supports TheyWorkForYou's public education purpose, and provide more advanced tools and data to specalists. 

# Decisions

This site divides decisions made into divisions and agreements.

Divisions are decisions made with a vote, agreements are decisions taken without a vote (no objection made).

Agreements do not necessarily mean that all MPs supported the result, simply that there was no opposition.

# Different Parliaments

Motion detection is currently only avaliable for the UK House of Commons (post 2019) and Scottish Parliament (post 2024).

Votes are listed and linked for the UK House of Lords and Senedd (Welsh Parliament).

The Northern Ireland assembly is currently not covered. This is because the parser does not currently load divisions into TheyWorkForYou, and there are additional analysis requirements around correctly showing the results of votes with cross-community requirements.
